# scRNAseq-monocytes-MI-CCD

This repository contains the analysis code and workflows used to characterize human monocyte subsets in myocardial infarction (MI) and chronic coronary disease (CCD) patients using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). The analysis combines Galaxy-based preprocessing with downstream processing in R, and was developed as part of my doctoral research at the University of Freiburg.

## 🔬 Overview of Analysis Workflow

The scRNA-seq data processing and analysis were conducted in two main phases:

### 1. **Low-level preprocessing**
- Raw BCL files were demultiplexed into FASTQ using **Cell Ranger mkfastq** and **bcl2fastq**.
- Gene-barcode matrices were generated using **Cell Ranger count**.
- Initial quality control and preprocessing were performed on [Galaxy Europe](https://usegalaxy.eu):
  - Filtering of cells with high mitochondrial content or abnormal gene counts.
  - Merging of samples using **AnnData** tools.
  - Normalization based on the [Galaxy Scanpy tutorial](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/single-cell/tutorials/scrna-scanpy-pbmc3k/tutorial.html).

### 2. **Downstream analysis in R**
- AnnData files were converted to Seurat objects using **sceasy** and **reticulate**.
- Processed using **Seurat v5.0.3**, **SCTransform**, **UMAP**, **Louvain clustering**, and **CCA** for batch correction.
- Cell type annotation was done based on canonical markers.
- **Pseudobulk analysis** was carried out by:
  - Re-uploading the AnnData object to Galaxy.
  - Creating pseudobulk count matrices using **Decoupler**.
  - Running **edgeR** for differential gene expression (DEGs).
  - Performing GO/KEGG enrichment with **GOseq**, correcting for gene length bias.
